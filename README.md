# CHRONO COMBINE

The aim of the game is to flood the board with a single color.

Use the fewest selections possible, choose adjacent colors to fill them in.

Only tiles connect vertically or horizontally are considered adjacent.

There is no time limit but each level has an individually calculated minimum number of steps.
